# Conditional Sentences (Bedingungssätze)

Conditional sentences express **conditions** and their **consequences**. They describe situations that depend on certain conditions being met. In German, these sentences often use the conjunction **"wenn"** (if) to introduce the condition.

## Structure

Conditional sentences typically consist of two parts: the **if-clause** (Bedingungssatz) and the **main clause** (Hauptsatz). The verb placement varies depending on the clause type.

### Basic Structure

- **If-Clause + Main Clause**

**Example**: *Wenn es regnet, bleibe ich zu Hause.*  
*(If it rains, I stay at home.)*

## Types of Conditional Sentences

1. **Real Conditional (Echte Bedingungssätze)**: 
   - Describes a possible or likely situation in the present or future.
   - **Structure**: Present tense in both clauses.
   - **Example**: *Wenn du kommst, freue ich mich.*  
     *(If you come, I will be happy.)*

2. **Unreal Conditional (Unechte Bedingungssätze)**:
   - Describes hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situations, usually in the present or future. Often uses **Konjunktiv II** in the if-clause.
   - **Structure**: 
     - **Present Unreal**: *Wenn ich reich wäre, würde ich reisen.*  
       *(If I were rich, I would travel.)*
     - **Past Unreal**: *Wenn ich das gewusst hätte, wäre ich gekommen.*  
       *(If I had known that, I would have come.)*

## Key Points

- **If-Clause**: Introduced by **"wenn"**. The verb is placed second.
- **Main Clause**: The verb follows the subject and is in the indicative or subjunctive form, depending on the type of condition.
- **Konjunktiv II** is used for unreal conditions in the present or past.

## Examples

1. **Real Conditional**:
   - *Wenn du Hunger hast, gibt es Essen.*  
     *(If you are hungry, there is food.)*

2. **Unreal Conditional (Present)**:
   - *Wenn ich Zeit hätte, würde ich lernen.*  
     *(If I had time, I would study.)*

3. **Unreal Conditional (Past)**:
   - *Wenn ich die Antwort gewusst hätte, hätte ich gewonnen.*  
     *(If I had known the answer, I would have won.)*
