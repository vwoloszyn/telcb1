# Causal Nebensätze (Causal Subordinate Clauses)

Causal subordinate clauses are used to express **reason** or **cause** for an action or situation. They provide explanations as to why something happens and typically begin with specific conjunctions.

## Structure

A causal subordinate clause generally follows the main clause and is introduced by a conjunction. The verb in a subordinate clause is placed at the end.

### Common Conjunctions

1. **weil** (because)
   - Example: *Ich gehe nach Hause, weil ich müde bin.*  
     *(I am going home because I am tired.)*

2. **da** (since/because)
   - Example: *Da es regnet, bleiben wir zu Hause.*  
     *(Since it is raining, we are staying at home.)*

## Sentence Structure

### Main Clause + Causal Nebensatz

- The causal clause explains the reason for the action in the main clause.

**Example**: *Er hat das Fenster geöffnet, weil es warm war.*  
*(He opened the window because it was warm.)*

### Verb Placement

- In a causal subordinate clause, the conjugated verb goes to the end of the clause.

**Example**: *Ich esse, weil ich Hunger habe.*  
*(I eat because I am hungry.)*

## Key Points

- **Causal Nebensätze** provide reasons or causes for actions.
- Common conjunctions include **weil** and **da**.
- The verb is always positioned at the end of the subordinate clause.

## Examples

1. **weil**:  
   *Ich kann nicht kommen, weil ich arbeiten muss.*  
   *(I cannot come because I have to work.)*

2. **da**:  
   *Da sie krank ist, bleibt sie im Bett.*  
   *(Since she is sick, she stays in bed.)*

3. **Combined Use**:  
   *Wir gehen früher ins Bett, weil wir morgen früh aufstehen müssen.*  
   *(We are going to bed earlier because we have to get up early tomorrow.)*
