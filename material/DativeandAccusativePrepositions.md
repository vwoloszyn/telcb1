# Dative and Accusative Prepositions

In German, prepositions often dictate the case of the nouns or pronouns they govern. Understanding which prepositions require the **dative case** and which require the **accusative case** is crucial for correct grammar and sentence structure.

## Dative Prepositions

Dative prepositions are used with nouns or pronouns in the dative case. The dative case typically indicates the **indirect object** of a verb, often representing to whom or for whom something is done.

### Common Dative Prepositions

1. **aus** (out of, from)
2. **bei** (at, with)
3. **mit** (with)
4. **nach** (after, to)
5. **seit** (since, for)
6. **von** (from, of)
7. **zu** (to)

### Examples

- *Ich komme aus der Stadt.*  
  *(I come from the city.)*

- *Ich gehe mit meiner Freundin ins Kino.*  
  *(I am going to the cinema with my friend.)*

## Accusative Prepositions

Accusative prepositions are used with nouns or pronouns in the accusative case. The accusative case typically indicates the **direct object** of a verb, showing what is directly affected by the action.

### Common Accusative Prepositions

1. **durch** (through)
2. **f체r** (for)
3. **gegen** (against)
4. **ohne** (without)
5. **um** (around)

### Examples

- *Ich gehe durch den Park.*  
  *(I walk through the park.)*

- *Das Geschenk ist f체r dich.*  
  *(The gift is for you.)*

## Key Points

- **Dative Prepositions**: Require the dative case, indicating indirect objects or location. Common examples include *aus*, *bei*, and *mit*.
- **Accusative Prepositions**: Require the accusative case, indicating direct objects. Common examples include *durch*, *f체r*, and *gegen*.
- It is important to memorize which prepositions take which cases, as incorrect usage can lead to misunderstandings.

## Summary of Examples

   - *Ich bin seit einem Jahr in Berlin.*  
     *(I have been in Berlin for a year.)*
