# Double Infinitives with Modal Verbs in the Past

In German, double infinitives occur when a modal verb is used in the past tense along with a second verb in its infinitive form. This construction is often used to express actions that were intended or desired but may not have been completed.

## Structure

When forming a sentence with a modal verb in the past tense, the structure typically involves the **past participle** of the modal verb and the **infinitive** of the main verb.

### Example Structure

- **Subject + past tense form of the modal verb + **haben/sein** + **infinitive of the main verb**.**

### Examples

1. **können** (to be able to) → **konnte**
   - *Er hat das Spiel gewinnen können.*  
     *(He was able to win the game.)*

2. **müssen** (to have to) → **musste**
   - *Sie hat die Prüfung bestehen müssen.*  
     *(She had to pass the exam.)*

3. **wollen** (to want) → **wollte**
   - *Wir haben die Reise machen wollen.*  
     *(We wanted to take the trip.)*

### Key Points

- **Double Infinitive**: The structure combines a past tense modal verb and an infinitive verb.
- **Usage**: This construction is used to indicate necessity, ability, or intention in the past.
- **Auxiliary Verb**: The auxiliary verb **haben** or **sein** is used based on the main verb's requirements.

## Summary of Examples

1. **können**: 
   - *Er hat das Buch lesen können.*  
     *(He was able to read the book.)*

2. **müssen**: 
   - *Ich habe das Essen kochen müssen.*  
     *(I had to cook the meal.)*

3. **wollen**:
