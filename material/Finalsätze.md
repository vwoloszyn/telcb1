# Final Clauses (Finalsätze)

Final clauses express the **purpose** or **goal** of an action. They answer the question **“Why?”** regarding the action in the main clause. These clauses are introduced by specific conjunctions that indicate intention.

## Structure

A final clause typically follows the main clause and describes the intended outcome of the action. The verb in the subordinate clause is placed at the end.

### Common Conjunctions

1. **damit** (so that/in order that)
2. **um ... zu** (to/in order to)

### Examples of Structure

- **Main Clause + Final Clause**
  
1. **With "damit":**
   - *Ich lerne Deutsch, damit ich in Deutschland arbeiten kann.*  
     *(I am learning German so that I can work in Germany.)*

2. **With "um ... zu":**
   - *Ich lerne, um die Prüfung zu bestehen.*  
     *(I study to pass the exam.)*

### Verb Placement

- In a final clause, the conjugated verb is always placed at the end of the clause.
  
**Example**: *Er geht ins Fitnessstudio, um fit zu bleiben.*  
*(He goes to the gym to stay fit.)*

## Key Points

- **Purpose**: Final clauses express the intention behind an action.
- **Common Conjunctions**: Use **“damit”** for clauses that involve a subject change and **“um … zu”** for clauses with the same subject as the main clause.
- **Verb Position**: The verb is always at the end of the final clause.

## Summary of Examples

1. **With "damit"**:
   - *Sie spart Geld, damit sie ein neues Auto kaufen kann.*  
     *(She saves money so that she can buy a new car.)*

2. **With "um ... zu"**:
   - *Er geht früh ins Bett, um am Morgen fit zu sein.*  
     *(He goes to bed early to be fit in the morning.)*
