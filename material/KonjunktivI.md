# Subjunctive I (Konjunktiv I) for Indirect Speech

**Subjunctive I** (Konjunktiv I) is primarily used in German for reported speech (indirect speech). It allows speakers to report what someone else has said without directly quoting their words.

## Formation of Subjunctive I

To form the subjunctive I, you start with the **stem** of the verb and add specific endings. The endings vary based on the subject of the sentence.

### Conjugation Endings

| Subject      | Ending        |
|--------------|---------------|
| ich          | -e            |
| du           | -est          |
| er/sie/es    | -e            |
| wir          | -en           |
| ihr          | -et           |
| sie/Sie      | -en           |

### Examples of Conjugation

- **sein** (to be):
  - ich sei
  - du seist
  - er/sie/es sei
  - wir seien
  - ihr seiet
  - sie/Sie seien

- **haben** (to have):
  - ich habe
  - du habest
  - er/sie/es habe
  - wir haben
  - ihr habet
  - sie/Sie haben

## Usage in Indirect Speech

In indirect speech, Konjunktiv I is used to convey statements made by someone else without indicating the speaker's opinion. It is often introduced by a reporting verb such as *sagen* (to say), *behaupten* (to assert), or *fragen* (to ask).

### Structure

- **Direct Speech**: *Er sagt: "Ich habe Zeit."* (He says, "I have time.")
- **Indirect Speech**: *Er sagt, er habe Zeit.* (He says that he has time.)

### Key Points

1. **No Change in Meaning**: The use of subjunctive I does not change the meaning of the original statement; it simply indicates that it is a reported statement.
  
2. **Avoiding Ambiguity**: If the subjunctive I form is the same as the indicative form, then **Konjunktiv II** is often used to avoid ambiguity. For example:
   - *Er sagt, er wäre müde.* (He says he is tired.)

3. **Formal Contexts**: Subjunctive I is frequently used in formal contexts, such as news articles, reports, and academic writing.

### Examples

1. **Direct Speech**: *Maria sagt: "Ich komme morgen."*  
   **Indirect Speech**: *Maria sagt, sie komme morgen.* (Maria says she is coming tomorrow.)

2. **Direct Speech**: *Peter behauptet: "Ich kann schwimmen."*  
   **Indirect Speech**: *Peter behauptet, er könne schwimmen.* (Peter claims he can swim.)
