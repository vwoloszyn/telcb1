# Consecutive Clauses (Konsekutivsätze)

Consecutive clauses express a **result** or **consequence** of an action or situation described in the main clause. They answer the question **“What happens as a result?”** and provide information about the outcome.

## Structure

A consecutive clause typically follows the main clause and describes what happens as a consequence of the action. The verb in the subordinate clause is placed at the end.

### Common Conjunctions

1. **sodass** (so that)
2. **damit** (in order that) — less common in this context

### Examples of Structure

- **Main Clause + Consecutive Clause**

1. **With "sodass":**
   - *Er hat hart gearbeitet, sodass er die Prüfung bestanden hat.*  
     *(He worked hard, so that he passed the exam.)*

2. **With "damit"**: (though this is more for purpose)
   - *Sie hat die Tür geschlossen, damit die Kälte draußen bleibt.*  
     *(She closed the door so that the cold stays outside.)*

### Verb Placement

- In a consecutive clause, the conjugated verb is always placed at the end of the clause.
  
**Example**: *Das Wetter war schlecht, sodass wir nicht gehen konnten.*  
*(The weather was bad, so that we couldn’t go.)*

## Key Points

- **Result**: Consecutive clauses express the result or consequence of the action in the main clause.
- **Common Conjunction**: **“sodass”** is primarily used to introduce consecutive clauses.
- **Verb Position**: The verb is always at the end of the consecutive clause.

## Summary of Examples

1. **With "sodass"**:
   - *Er war müde, sodass er früh ins Bett ging.*  
     *(He was tired, so that he went to bed early.)*

2. **With "damit"** (less common for results):
   - *Es war zu laut, damit wir uns verstehen konnten.*  
     *(It was too loud for us to understand each other.)*
