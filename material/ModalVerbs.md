   - Past: *Ich konnte schwimmen.* (I could swim.)

2. **müssen** (must, to have to)
   - Present: *Ich muss gehen.* (I must go.)

5. **sollen** (should, to be supposed to)
   - Present: *Ich soll lernen.* (I should study.)
   - Past: *Ich sollte lernen.* (I should have studied.)

## Usage

- **Present Tense**: Modal verbs in the present tense indicate ongoing ability, necessity, or permission.
  
- **Past Tense**: The past forms of modal verbs are used to indicate what was possible, necessary, or permitted in the past.
