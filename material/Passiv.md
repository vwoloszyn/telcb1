# Passive Voice (Passiv)

The passive voice in German is used to emphasize the action or the recipient of the action rather than the doer. It is commonly employed in situations where the doer is unknown, irrelevant, or less important than the action itself.

## Formation of Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed using the auxiliary verb **werden** combined with the **past participle** (Partizip II) of the main verb.

### Structure

- **Present Passive**:
  - **Form**: *Subjekt + wird + Partizip II*
  - **Example**: *Das Buch wird gelesen.* (The book is being read.)

- **Past Passive**:
  - **Form**: *Subjekt + wurde + Partizip II*
  - **Example**: *Das Buch wurde gelesen.* (The book was read.)

- **Future Passive**:
  - **Form**: *Subjekt + wird + Partizip II + werden*
  - **Example**: *Das Buch wird gelesen werden.* (The book will be read.)

### Common Usage

1. **To Highlight the Action**: The focus is on the action rather than who is performing it.
   - Example: *Die Hausaufgaben werden gemacht.* (The homework is being done.)

2. **When the Doer is Unknown**: When the person performing the action is not important or unknown.
   - Example: *Das Fenster ist zerbrochen.* (The window has been broken. [By whom? Unknown.])

3. **Formal Writing**: Often used in formal writing or news reporting where the action takes precedence over the actor.
   - Example: *Die Gesetze wurden geändert.* (The laws were changed.)

### Conversion from Active to Passive

To convert an active sentence to passive, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. The original subject may be omitted or included in a prepositional phrase introduced by **von**.

- **Active**: *Der Lehrer erklärt die Grammatik.* (The teacher explains the grammar.)
- **Passive**: *Die Grammatik wird (vom Lehrer) erklärt.* (The grammar is explained (by the teacher).)

### Summary of Key Points

- The passive voice emphasizes the action and the recipient.
- Formed with the verb *werden* + past participle.
- Used in various tenses (present, past, future).
- Often omits the doer or includes it with the preposition *von*.
