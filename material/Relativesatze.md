**Relative clauses (Relativsätze)** in German are used to provide additional information about a noun or pronoun in a sentence. They help to define or specify the noun more precisely.

### Structure of Relative Clauses

1. **Relative Pronouns**: Relative clauses are introduced by relative pronouns, which refer back to the noun they modify. The main relative pronouns in German are:
   - **der, die, das** (who, which, that) - used for people and things.
   - **welcher, welche, welches** (which) - a more formal alternative.
   - **wer** (who) - used for people when the antecedent is not defined.

2. **Word Order**: In relative clauses, the **verb usually comes at the end** of the clause.
   - Example: *Das Buch, das ich lese, ist spannend.* (The book that I am reading is exciting.)

### Forms of Relative Pronouns

- The form of the relative pronoun changes depending on the **gender**, **number**, and **case** of the noun it refers to:

| Gender/Case  | Nominative | Accusative | Dative  | Genitive    |
|--------------|------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Masculine    | der        | den        | dem     | dessen      |
| Feminine     | die        | die        | der     | deren       |
| Neuter       | das        | das        | dem     | dessen      |
| Plural       | die        | die        | denen   | deren       |

### Examples of Relative Clauses

1. **Defining a person**:
   - *Die Frau, die dort steht, ist meine Mutter.*  
   *(The woman who is standing there is my mother.)*

2. **Defining an object**:
   - *Das Auto, das ich gekauft habe, ist rot.*  
   *(The car that I bought is red.)*

3. **Providing additional information**:
   - *Das Buch, das auf dem Tisch liegt, gehört mir.*  
   *(The book that is lying on the table belongs to me.)*

### Types of Relative Clauses

1. **Restrictive Relative Clauses** (Einschränkende Relativsätze):  
   - These specify which noun we are talking about and are essential for the meaning of the sentence.
   - Example: *Die Studenten, die fleißig lernen, bestehen die Prüfung.*  
     *(The students who study diligently pass the exam.)*

2. **Non-restrictive Relative Clauses** (Nicht einschränkende Relativsätze):  
   - These provide additional information but are not essential to identify the noun. They are usually set off by commas.
   - Example: *Mein Bruder, der in Berlin lebt, besucht uns nächste Woche.*  
     *(My brother, who lives in Berlin, is visiting us next week.)*

### Summary
Relative clauses in German are an important grammatical feature that allows you to add detail to sentences, clarify meanings, and make your writing more descriptive. Mastery of relative pronouns, their forms, and the proper structure of relative clauses is crucial for fluency in German.
