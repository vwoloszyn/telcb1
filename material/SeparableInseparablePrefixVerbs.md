# Separable and Inseparable Prefix Verbs

In German, many verbs can be modified by prefixes, which can either be **separable** or **inseparable**. Understanding the difference between these types is essential for correct conjugation and usage in sentences.

## Separable Prefix Verbs

Separable prefix verbs are verbs that can have their prefixes detached in certain sentence structures, particularly in the present and simple past tenses. When the prefix is separated, it typically moves to the end of the sentence.

### Structure

- **Base Verb + Separable Prefix**

### Examples

1. **abholen** (to pick up)
   - *Ich hole dich ab.*  
     *(I will pick you up.)*
   
2. **aufstehen** (to get up)
   - *Er steht um 7 Uhr auf.*  
     *(He gets up at 7 o'clock.)*

### Sentence Example

- *Ich stehe jeden Morgen früh auf.*  
  *(I get up early every morning.)*

## Inseparable Prefix Verbs

Inseparable prefix verbs cannot be separated from their prefixes. The prefix remains attached to the verb in all forms, including present and past tenses.

### Structure

- **Inseparable Prefix + Base Verb**

### Examples

1. **verstehen** (to understand)
   - *Ich verstehe das nicht.*  
     *(I do not understand that.)*

2. **behalten** (to keep)
   - *Sie behält das Buch.*  
     *(She keeps the book.)*

### Sentence Example

- *Er hat das Problem verstanden.*  
  *(He understood the problem.)*

## Key Points

- **Separable Verbs**: Prefixes can be detached in sentences, especially in the present tense and simple past tense. The prefix moves to the end of the clause.
- **Inseparable Verbs**: Prefixes remain attached to the verb in all forms; they cannot be separated.
- Knowing whether a verb is separable or inseparable affects how it is conjugated and used in sentences.

## Summary of Examples

1. **Separable**: *Ich mache das Licht aus.*  
   *(I turn off the light.)*

2. **Inseparable**: *Er hat den Kurs begonnen.*  
   *(He started the course.)*
