# Cases in German: Nominative, Accusative, Dative, and Genitive

In German, the case system is crucial for determining the function of nouns and pronouns in a sentence. The four primary cases are **nominative**, **accusative**, **dative**, and **genitive**.

## 1. Nominative Case (Nominativ)

### Function
- The nominative case is used for the **subject** of a sentence—the person or thing performing the action.

### How to Detect
- Ask the question **“Who or what is doing something?”**

### Examples
- **Der Hund schläft.**  
  *(The dog is sleeping.)*  
  → *Der Hund* (the dog) is the subject.

- **Die Kinder spielen im Garten.**  
  *(The children are playing in the garden.)*  
  → *Die Kinder* (the children) is the subject.

## 2. Accusative Case (Akkusativ)

### Function
- The accusative case is used for the **direct object** of a verb—the person or thing directly affected by the action.

### How to Detect
- Ask the question **“What or whom is being affected?”**

### Examples
- **Ich sehe den Hund.**  
  *(I see the dog.)*  
  → *den Hund* (the dog) is the direct object.

- **Er hat einen Ball.**  
  *(He has a ball.)*  
  → *einen Ball* (a ball) is the direct object.

## 3. Dative Case (Dativ)

### Function
- The dative case is used for the **indirect object** of a verb—the person or thing that receives something or is affected by the action indirectly.

### How to Detect
- Ask the question **“To whom or for whom is something done?”**

### Examples
- **Ich gebe dem Hund einen Knochen.**  
  *(I give the dog a bone.)*  
  → *dem Hund* (the dog) is the indirect object.

- **Sie erzählt ihrer Freundin eine Geschichte.**  
  *(She tells her friend a story.)*  
  → *ihrer Freundin* (her friend) is the indirect object.

## 4. Genitive Case (Genitiv)

### Function
- The genitive case shows **possession** or relationship between nouns.

### How to Detect
- Ask the question **“Whose?”**

### Examples
- **Das Buch des Lehrers.**  
  *(The teacher’s book.)*  
  → *des Lehrers* (the teacher’s) shows possession.

- **Die Farbe des Autos.**  
  *(The color of the car.)*  
  → *des Autos* (of the car) shows possession.
